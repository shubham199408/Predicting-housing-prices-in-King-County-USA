#### Predicting-housing-prices-in-King-County-USA

**Overview**

The dataset that was used for this project consists of sales data between May 2014 and May 2015 in King County, Washington, which includes the 18th most populous city in the US, Seattle. Our group sourced this data set from the website Kaggle, which focuses on data science learning, and houses a vast library of datasets across numerous industries. This dataset was chosen due its size, number of numerical and categorical variables, relative cleanliness, completeness and ease of interpretation. It is a CSV file that contains 21,614 rows (21,613 observation & 1 header row), and 21 columns. The table below summarizes the columns, and our interpretation of them

In this analysis, I used several Python packages/techniques including, but not limited to: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Sci-kit Learn, which will all be highlighted in the following sections of this report, and can be viewed in the Python code for the project. Ultimately, My main objective is to understand the trend in housing prices for King County during this time period; along with what factors have the largest influence on price.
